# NPM Scripts

The idea of this repo is to replace the gulp system with a focus on NPM scripts,
thereby getting a lot more power out of NPM, unconstrained by gulp's streaming api.

## Install/Run

1. `docker-compose up`
2. Access at `http://localhost`

## Build

1. `docker-compose up`
2. In another tab: `docker-compose exec web npm run build`
